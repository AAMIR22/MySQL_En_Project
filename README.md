# Library Management System

This **Library Management System** is a **database-driven project** designed to efficiently manage books, customers, employees, and transactions within a library. The system consists of **six main tables**—Branch, Employee, Books, Customer, IssueStatus, and ReturnStatus—allowing structured record-keeping for book availability, rental prices, borrowing activities, and employee management. Included **SQL queries** enable users to retrieve critical insights such as available books, customer borrowing patterns, employee salaries, and book categories, while additional queries analyze branch-wise employee distribution, customers with high-rental books, and branch managers. The project ensures **seamless library operations** by maintaining accurate records and enabling **actionable analytics** to improve decision-making.
